# complete-pomodoro

This Project was built to utilize the pomodoro time managment technique

This website would be most useful in large projects/studying or anything that requires some downtime. It can often be difficult to but a time limit of productivity but with this timer it will hopefully be easier to segment time into more productive increments.

This website includes dynamic time intervals for both rest and focus time as well as setting limits based on the original pomodoro technique.

I hope to build more syles into this website to make it more aesthetically pleasing in the future.
